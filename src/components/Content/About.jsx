                I'm a frontend developer with a growing passion for fullstack development. I'm drawn to the craft of building clean, intuitive user interfaces — especially when there's room for creative interaction and smooth animation. While I've explored backend work too, my heart is in the frontend, where design meets code.
            </p>

            <p>What keeps me going is simple: I love to code. Whether it's refining a layout or bringing an interface to life with motion, I find a kind of flow in building things that feel good to use.</p>

            <p>Currently, I'm doing an internship at <a href="https://1buy.ai/" target="_blank" className="text-white hover:text-[#58ffcf] font-semibold">1BUY.AI</a> , where I'm learning what it takes to ship real products while sharpening my approach to clean, thoughtful development.</p>

            <p>Outside the screen, you'll probably find me at the gym, out in the mountains, or just recharging while diving into something new — I'm curious by nature and always chasing the next idea.</p>
