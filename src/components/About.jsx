        I'm a <strong>full-stack developer</strong> who loves building end-to-end
        applications — from designing clean, intuitive interfaces to architecting
        scalable backend systems. My strength lies in crafting smooth user
        experiences with modern frontend frameworks, while also engineering the
        APIs and databases that power them.

        I enjoy the entire process of development: designing UI flows, wiring up
        backend logic, integrating third-party services, and deploying
        production-ready apps. What drives me is the challenge of turning an idea
        into a real product that people can actually use.

        Outside of coding, you’ll usually find me in the gym, out in nature, or
        exploring new skills and ideas. Curiosity keeps me moving, and I’m always
        looking for the next opportunity to learn and build.
